LIMIT_REFERENCE_POINT,"The LRP represents the stock status, usually in terms of biomass (or abundance), below which â€œserious harmâ€ to the stock  may be incurred. In Canada and elsewhere, serious harm is considered to include recruitment  overfishing or other impairment to productive capacity. When the stock falls below LRP, urgent management actions are required to rebuild the population and prevent further depletion. It represents the minimum level needed to sustain a fish population over time. Under the Fish Stocks provisions, the LRP is determined solely by DFO Science based on biological considerations.",Number of fish,https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40965715.pdf,INTEGER,NA,NA,SPSR
UPPER_STOCK_REFERENCE,"The primary role of the USR is to serve as a threshold to progressive reduction of the fishing mortality rate to avoid stock status reaching the LRP. The USR is also assigned the role of delineating the threshold between what are termed the Cautious and Healthy Zones. When stock levels are above USR, they are considered healthy. However, if they drop below the USR but remain above the LRP, the stock enters the cautious zone, signaling a need for more conservative management measures to prevent further decline.",Number of fish,https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40965715.pdf,INTEGER,NA,NA,SPSR
