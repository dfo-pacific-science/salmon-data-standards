region,"One of nine regions defined for organizing data in the PSE: Yukon, Transboundary, Haida Gwaii, Nass, Skeena, Central Coast, VIMI, Fraser, Columbia"
species,"One of six species: Chinook, chum, coho, pink, sockeye, steelhead"
year,Calendar year the estimates correspond to
spawners,"The raw spawner abundance estimate (may be an index, model estimate, or absolute count depending on region and species)"
smoothedSpawners,Spawners smoothed using a right-aligned running geometric mean over the dominant generation length for the region and species.
runsize,"The raw run size estimate (a.k.a. total abundance; may be an index, model estimate, or absolute count depending on region and species)"
smoothedRunsize,Run size smoothed using a right-aligned running geometric mean over the dominant generation length for the region and species.
